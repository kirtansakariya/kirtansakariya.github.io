                    <h1>About Me</h1>
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a <Strong>Bachelor of Computer Science</Strong> at the <Strong>University of Pittsburgh</Strong>. Alongside that, I am working on completing a <Strong>Mathematics Minor</Strong> as well.</p>
                    <p>I am interested in going into the <Strong>Software Development</Strong> part of the field. <Strong>Cyber Security</Strong> is a point of interest for me as well, but I am thinking of going into a different field initially in order to gain a better understanding of how to protect again certain issues. My mind has not been made up as of yet and am open to any input that anyone may have regarding the issue.</p>
                    <p>Temporary goals section: I have recently started using <Strong>GitHub</Strong> and as a result, there is not much content on there. As of right now, the only project on GitHub is my <Strong>website</Strong>. I wish to keep working on my website as much as possible over summer and make changes to make it look <Strong>appealing and informative</Strong>. Over the summer, I hope to add some <Strong>Python practice files</Strong> as I learn Python. Another goal is to start some sort of <Strong>project</Strong> either over the summer or next year. This may be best achieved after I have knowledge of at least two languages so that I can contribute more to said project. I am learning <Strong>JavaScript</Strong> as of right now using a textbook that I found online. The textbook has proven to be fairly helpful. Alongside that, I am also using <Strong>freecodecamp.com to pratice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</Strong>.</p>

                    <p>Playing <Strong>video games</Strong> has been a huge part of my life for quite some time now. Most of these games include multiplayer games like rpgs, mobas, and fps games. While it may not be the most professional hobby, video games are where my <Strong>passion for programming</Strong> come from. I've been wanting to make a game or help with a game for quite some time now and learning programming is one of the best ways to go about this.</p>

                    <p>I have recently started using <Strong>GitHub</Strong> and as a result, there is not much content on there. As of right now, the only project on GitHub is my <Strong>website</Strong>. I wish to keep working on my website as much as possible over summer and make changes to make it look <Strong>appealing and informative</Strong>. In addition to that, the website will slowly be filled with information about myself as updates are needed.</p>
                    <p>Over the summer, I hope to add some <Strong>Python practice files</Strong> as I learn Python. I will try to apply concepts that I learn through videos when creating these files. They will most likely all go into the same respository. These will mainly be for my own practice and will aid me in learning Python.</p>
                    <p>As obvious of a goal this might be, I would like to start some sort of project or help in one that already exists. The University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science Club had a project in the Spring semester of 2017. I was not able to participate due to schedules, but am hoping that they have something similar next year for me to participate in. In order to achieve this goal, I will need to learn more programming languages so that I can contribute more to projects and am not as limited as I was last year.</p>

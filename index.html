                    <p>I am currently pursuing a <Strong>Bachelor of Computer Science</Strong> at the <Strong>University of Pittsburgh</Strong>. Alongside that, I am working on completing a <Strong>Mathematics Minor</Strong> as well.</p>
                    <p>I am interested in going into the <Strong>Software Development</Strong> part of the field. <Strong>Cyber Security</Strong> is a point of interest for me as well, but I am thinking of going into a different field initially in order to gain a better understanding of how to protect again certain issues. My mind has not been made up as of yet and so I am open to any input that anyone may have regarding the issue.</p>
                    <p>The majority of my experience lies in <Strong>Java</Strong>. I am trying to change this by achieving some of the goals that I have listed down below in my goals swction. I would like to learn at least two more languages in order to accomplish my goals.</p>

                    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                    <p>Playing <Strong>video games</Strong> has been a huge part of my life for quite some time now. Most of these games include multiplayer games like rpgs, mobas, and fps games. While it may not be the most professional hobby, video games are where my <Strong>passion for programming</Strong> come from. I've been wanting to make a game or help with a game for quite some time now and learning programming is one of the best ways to go about doing this.</p>
                    <p>I have been extremely fascinated by and interested in <Strong>the cosmos</Strong> for quite some time. I used to spend a lot of my time watching <Strong>videos and shows on television</Strong> about space. I still watch these shows and vidoes quite a bit but do not get to watch as much as I used to due to time restrictions.</p>

                    <h1>Goals</h1>
                    <p>I have recently started using <Strong>GitHub</Strong> and as a result, there is not much content on there. As of right now, the only project on GitHub is my <Strong>website</Strong>. I wish to keep working on my website as much as possible over summer and make changes to make it look <Strong>appealing and informative</Strong>. In addition to that, the website will slowly be filled with information about myself as updates are needed.</p>
                    <p>Over the summer, I hope to add some <Strong>Python practice files</Strong> as I learn Python. I will try to apply concepts that I learn through videos when creating these files. They will most likely all go into the same respository. These will mainly be for my own practice and will hopefully aid me in learning Python. Update: I have started learning Python using DataCamp. I hope to do more with Python on my GitHub when I gain more knowledge on it.</p>
                    <p>As obvious of a goal as this might be, I would like to start some sort of project or help in one that already exists. The <Strong>University of Pittsburgh's Computer Science Club</Strong> had a project in the Spring semester of 2017. I was not able to participate due to schedule conflicts, but I am hoping that they have something similar next year for me to participate in. In order to achieve this goal, I will need to learn more programming languages so that I can contribute more to projects and am not as limited as I was last year.</p>
                    <p>I would like to learn JavaScript to help with this website. I just finished reading a textbook on JavaScript that I found online. Alongside the textbook, I am also using <Strong>freecodecamp.com to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</Strong>.</p>
